I want to make a cli/terminal/console/tty/shell/bash session window text based space game with C++ 11 or C++ 14 or C++ 17 standard. There will be many files that control functions of the game.  I want to use .cpp and .h files not .cpp and .hpp files. I want to build for linux x86_64 and Windows 7 first before I build for Macintosh.  It is likely that the program should run on debian 10 buster linux with kernel 4.19.0-25-amd64, bash 5.0.3 on a disk with ext4 and a tempfs.  I am using VSCode 1.81 for Debian linux. I want to build in my StarshipAscension/build directory. I have GNU 8.3.0 installed.  Here are the files structure I have.  I want the playing field ot play in a 207 character wide by 57 character tall full size cli/terminal/console/tty/shell/bash session window and use ansi, ascii, unicode, utf8 characters I am using both clang 11 and gcc 8 and g++ 8.

I need a main.cpp with main() for an entry point for the game. the main game logic will be in Game.cpp/Game.h all of the other files shown here will be used as the logic for the game and game objects and ships and weapons, etc.  Menu.cpp/Menu.h will be brought in to the main.cpp to display the menu for the game and the menu logic.  PlayingField will control the PlayingField.
